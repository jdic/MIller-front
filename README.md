# Chemical Miller Frotend

In this project of C2 P1 of mechatronics engineering, I made a ball mill, which has the purpose of grinding chemical elements (one or more) with the point of making a uniform and fine union between the two elements.

The objective of the project is to make a uniform and fine mixture of two chemical elements to perform a combustion, the combustion must not have residues, so it must be a well done grinding.

This frontend is used to communicate changes to ESP32 visually, it was built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [SWC](https://swc.rs/).
